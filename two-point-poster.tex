%The \emph{random blob} model, or the Boolean model, places balls of radius $r$ centred at the points
%of a homogeneous Poisson point process $\mathcal{P}$
%in a set $A$
%with an intensity $\mu$.
%It is closely related to the random geometric graph,
%in which two points of $\mathcal{P}$
%are joined with an edge if the distance between them
%is less than $2r$.
%If the relationship between the number of balls and the radii
%is such that the average degree of a point,
%which is proportional to $\mu r^d$,
%converges to a constant
%then the model can be thought of as a form of percolation.
%
%Indeed, if $A = \mathbb{R}^d$ or a half-space and $r=1$,
%the random blob model is often called \emph{continuum percolation},
%parameterised by the intensity.
%Many well-known properties of discrete percolation are known
%to also hold for continuum percolation,
%such as existence of a non-trivial critical intensity
%and the existence of a unique unbounded component.
%
%We will discuss recent work
%on the two-point connection function
%for the Boolean model.
%%
%If $A$ is a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$
%with a sufficiently smooth boundary,
%then given distinct $x, y \in \partial A$,
%we prove a limit theorem for the probability
%that $x$ and $y$ are joined by a path in the Boolean model.
%In particular,
%if $\theta_A(\lambda)$ is the probability that the
%origin is contained in an unbounded component
%in continuum percolation with intensity $\lambda$ in $A$,
%then we show
%that if $\lambda r^d \to \mu$
%as $\lambda \to \infty$,
%then the probability that $x$ and $y$ lie in the same component
%converges to $\theta_{\mathbb{H}}(\mu)^2$.
%
%Our proof involves a renormalisation argument
%relating certain events for the Boolean model in $A$
%explicitly to corresponding events for continuum percolation
%in $\mathbb{H}$.

\block{Continuum percolation}{
	Let $A \subseteq \R^d$ be open, and let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $A$.
	Let $\mathcal{X} := (X_1, X_2, \dots)$ be a family of iid points distributed according to $\mu$,
	and for $n \geq 1$ let $\mathcal{X}_n := (X_1, \dots, X_n)$.
	For a given $r > 0$
	let $Z(n,r) := \bigcup_{x \in \mathcal{X}_n} B(x,r)$,
	where $B(x,r) := \{ y \in \R^d : \| x - y \| \leq r \}$.
	We call $Z(n,r)$ the \emph{Boolean model}.
	
	Suppose that $A$ is bounded,
	and take $\mu$ to be normalised Lebesgue measure.
	Without loss of generality also suppose that $A$ has Lebesgue measure 1.

\block{Connectivity events}{
	Let $B \subseteq A$.
	Given $\mathcal{X}_n$,
	the \emph{coverage threshold}
	for $B$ is defined as
	\[
		R_n := \inf\{ r > 0 : B \subseteq Z(n,r) \}.
	\]
	If $\overline{B} \subseteq A$,
	then we can avoid boundary effects.
	The behaviour of the coverage event in this case
	has been understood since the mid 1980s
	\cite{hall85} \cite{janson86}.
	
	In this case, we have the strong law \cite{euclidean-coverage}
	\[
		\frac{n \theta_d R_n^d}{\log n} \to 1
	\]
	almost surely as $n \to \infty$,
	where $\theta_d$ is the volume of a unit ball.
	Note that $n \theta_d R_n^d$ is the total volume of the balls $\{ B(x,R_n) : x \in \mathcal{X}_n \}$.
	% whose union is $Z(n,r)$.

\block{Renormalisation}{
	To construct long-range connections in the Boolean model,
	we define a finite grid with spacing $M r_n$ (for some large constant $M$)
	and construct a \emph{site percolation} model on this grid
	using the Boolean model.

	Let $x, y \in \partial A$,

	Let $\theta_{\mathbb{H}}(\lambda)$
	be the percolation probability
	at intensity $\lambda$
	in the half-space $\mathbb{H} := [0,\infty) \times \R^{d-1}$,
	i.e.\ if $\mathcal{P}_\lambda$
	is a homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity $\lambda$ in $\mathbb{H}$,
	and $Z(\lambda) := \bigcup_{x \in \mathcal{P}_\lambda} B(x,1)$,
	then
	$\theta_{\mathbb{H}}(\lambda) := \P[ 0 \leftrightarrow \infty \text{ in } Z(\lambda) ]$.
	
	In upcoming work, we prove that if $\partial A$ is sufficiently smooth,
	then
	$
		\P( x \leftrightarrow y ) \to \theta_{\mathbb{H}}(\lambda)^2
	$

	The above result shows that,
	with high probability,
	long-range connections
	do not exist if $\lambda \leq \lambda_c$,
	where $\lambda_c$ is the critical intensity for half-space percolation,
	and do exist if $\lambda > \lambda_c$.
	
	We expect other percolation-type results
	to also hold for the Boolean model in this scaling regime,
	such as the proportion of the boundary connected to the largest component
	converging to $\theta_{\mathbb{H}}(\lambda)$.
	
	Left:
	this regime
	using the same sample of $\mathcal{X}_n$
	with $\lambda = 1.0$, $1.1$ and $1.2$
	from top to bottom.
	Clusters are coloured according to their size.
